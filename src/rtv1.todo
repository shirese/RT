 ✔ Spherical mapping ? @done (17-11-13 15:00)
   I must apply a transformation to the point of intersection so that the mapping sphere
   is positioned and oriented with respect to the object.
 ☐ Streching texture
 ☐ Offsetting texture
 ☐ Use a library to load an image
   I must map (s, t) to a 2d array created from a loaded img
   How can I know (s, t) min/max in advance ?
   I know it's [0, 1] if spherical mapping so I can map img resolution to it.
